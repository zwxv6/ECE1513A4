# ECE1513A4 
In this assignment, you will implement the k-means and mixture of Gaussian (MoG) models, using PyTorch. The functions are provided and you will need to fill-in after the TODO comment instead of coding them from scratch. There are two parts in this assignment and we provide the dataset data2D.npy in the attached folder for both parts. In the first part, you will use PyTorch and gradient descent to implement the k-means clustering model in KMEANS.py. You will also compare the performance of your implementation to the one in scikit-learn. In the second part, we shift our focus to the MoG model and implement its learning and inference algorithms in GMM.py. Similar to the first part, instead of using EM algorithm, we will optimize the parameters using gradient descent. You will need to complete the training loop and explain in your report the functionality of some existing functions in GMM.py. Finally, for both parts, you will also be asked to answer several questions related to your implementations.
